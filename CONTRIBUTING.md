# Contributing

This document has helpful information for people wishing to contribute
changes to `pass-ln`.

## Running the tests

`pass-ln` has some simple integration tests written using
[ShellSpec](https://shellspec.info/). If you have ShellSpec installed,
you can simply run `shellspec` in the repository to run the tests. You
must have Pass and dependencies installed already.

If you don't want to install ShellSpec, you can use
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) instead. Simply run `docker build .
-t pass-ln` to build an image with all the dependencies installed, and
then run `./docker/run-in-docker.bash pass-ln shellspec`.

You can also create a pull request, and the tests will be run
automatically by GitHub Actions. You may want to mark such a pull
request as a "draft" until you are ready for it to be reviewed.

## Release process

1. Update the changelog to indicate the version number and date of the
   latest release, and commit.
2. Place a tag on the commit with the new version number, prefixed
   with `v`.
3. Run `make` in the `packaging` directory and verify there are no
   errors.
4. Push the new commit and tag to GitHub.
5. Create a GitHub Release, copy and paste the relevant subsection
   from the changelog into the release notes, and upload the assets in
   `out/x.y.z` that were generated by `make`.
6. In the
   [homebrew-pass-ln](https://github.com/radian-software/homebrew-pass-ln)
   repository, run `./update.sh` to generate a new commit, and push
   it.
7. In the [pass-ln AUR
   repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pass-ln), run
   `./update.sh` to generate a new commit, and push it. Note: you can
   run `./archlinux-shell.sh` to get a shell with `makepkg` and
   friends installed, if you are not running Arch Linux.
