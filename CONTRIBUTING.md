## Release process

1. Update the changelog to indicate the version number and date of the
   latest release, and commit.
2. Place a tag on the commit with the new version number, prefixed
   with `v`.
3. Run `make` in the `packaging` directory and verify there are no
   errors.
4. Push the new commit and tag to GitHub.
5. Create a GitHub Release, copy and paste the relevant subsection
   from the changelog into the release notes, and upload the assets in
   `out/x.y.z` that were generated by `make`.
6. In the
   [homebrew-pass-ln](https://github.com/raxod502/homebrew-pass-ln)
   repository, run `./update.sh` to generate a new commit, and push
   it.
7. In the [pass-ln AUR
   repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pass-ln), run
   `./update.sh` to generate a new commit, and push it. Note: you can
   run `./archlinux-shell.sh` to get a shell with `makepkg` and
   friends installed, if you are not running Arch Linux.
