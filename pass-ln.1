.TH PASS-LN 1
.SH NAME
pass ln \- Pass extension for creating symbolic links
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pass ln
\fITARGET\fR
\fILINK_NAME\fR
.br
.B pass ln
\fITARGET\fR
\fIDIRECTORY\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
In the first form, create an entry in the password store named
\fILINK_NAME\fR which acts as an alias to an existing entry named
\fITARGET\fR.  This is implemented by creating a symbolic link at
\fILINK_NAME\fR.  Both \fITARGET\fR and \fILINK_NAME\fR must be
relative to the root of the password store, but \fITARGET\fR is
automatically converted to a path relative to \fILINK_NAME\fR's parent
directory when creating the symbolic link, to ensure it can be
dereferenced correctly.  Note that \fITARGET\fR may be either a file
(with no \fB.gpg\fR suffix) or directory.
.PP
The second form is equivalent to the first form except that
\fILINK_NAME\fR is implicitly postpended with the last component of
\fITARGET\fR, as in the \fBln -s\fR command.  The second form is
assumed when \fILINK_NAME\fR refers to an existing directory, or when
\fILINK_NAME\fR has a trailing slash, and the first form is assumed
otherwise.
.PP
Unlike with \fBln -s\fR, this command automatically creates all parent
directories of \fILINK_NAME\fR, including \fILINK_NAME\fR itself if it
does not exist but the provided name has a trailing slash.
.SH OPTIONS
This command has no options.
.SH EXIT STATUS
This command follows the standard convention of a zero exit status
indicating success.  No guarantees are made about the exit status on
an error except that it will be nonzero.
.SH EXAMPLES

.SH NOTES
There is no option to overwrite an existing file or directory with a
symbolic link. To do this, first \fBpass rm\fR the existing file or
directory, then create the symbolic link with \fBpass ln\fR.
