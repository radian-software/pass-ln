# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version of `pass-ln` is supported with security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please contact me at
[radon.neon@gmail.com](mailto:radon.neon@gmail.com). Although I work
on `pass-ln` in my free time, I take security seriously, so I will do
my best to get back to you in less than a week, and to correct the
vulnerability as soon as possible (I will let you know the likely
timeline by email).
